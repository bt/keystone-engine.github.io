Keypatch is a IDA Pro plugin for [Keystone Assembler Engine](http://keystone-engine.org).
See [this introduction](/keypatch0) for the motivation behind this tool.

[Keypatch v1.0](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keypatch/archive/1.0.zip) is available from our [Github repo](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keypatch).

Keypatch consists of 2 tools inside.

- **Patcher**: this allows you to type in assembly to directly patch your binary.
- **Assembler**: this interactive tool let you enter assembly & get back instruction encoding.

Keypatch is confirmed to work on IDA Pro version 6.4, 6.8 & 6.9, but should work flawlessly on older versions.
If you find any issues, please [report](http://keystone-engine.org/contact).


--------------------

### 1. Why Keypatch?

Sometimes we want to patch the binary while analyzing it in IDA, but unfortunately the built-in asssembler of IDA Pro is not adequate.

- Only X86 assembler is available. Support for all other architectures is totally missing.
- The X86 assembler is buggy and fails to understand many modern Intel instructions.
- This tool is not friendly and without many options that would make the life of reverser easier.

Keypatch was developed to solve this problem. Thanks to the power of [Keystone](http://keystone-engine.org), our plugin offers some nice features.

- More friendly & easier to use.
- Cross-architecture: support Arm, Arm64 (AArch64/Armv8), Hexagon, Mips, PowerPC, Sparc, SystemZ & X86 (include 16/32/64bit).
- Cross-platform: work everywhere that IDA works, which is on Windows, MacOS, Linux.
- Based on Python, so it is easy to install as no compilation is needed.
- Open source under GPL v2.

Keypatch can be the missing piece in your toolset of reverse engineering.

### 2. Install

- Keypatch requires Keystone, so you have to install Keystone core & Python binding for Python 2.7 from [keystone-engine.org/download](http://keystone-engine.org/download). Or follow the steps in the [appendix section](#appendix-install-keystone-for-ida-pro).

- Copy file `keypatch.py` to IDA Plugin folder, then restart IDA Pro to use Keypatch.
    - On Windows, the folder is at `C:\Program Files (x86)\IDA 6.9\plugins`
    - On MacOS, the folder is at `/Applications/IDA\ Pro\ 6.9/idaq.app/Contents/MacOS/plugins`
    - On Linux, the folder may be at `/opt/IDA/plugins/`

`NOTE`
- On Windows, if you get an error message from IDA about "fail to load the dynamic library", then your machine may miss the VC++ runtime library. Fix that by downloading & installing it from https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784

- On other \*nix platforms, the above error message means you do not have 32-bit Keystone installed yet. See [appendix section](#appendix-install-keystone-for-ida-pro) below for more instructions to fix this.


------------

### 3. Usage

- To patch your binary, press hotkey `CTRL+ALT+K` inside IDA to open **Keypatch Patcher** dialog.
    - The original assembly, encode & instruction size will be displayed in 3 controls at the top part of the form.
    - Choose the syntax, type new assembly instruction in the `Assembly` box (you can use IDA symbols).
    - Keypatch would *automatically* update the encoding in the `Encode` box while you are typing, without waiting for `ENTER` keystroke.
        - Note that you can type IDA symbols, and the raw assembly will be displayed in the `Fixup` control.
    - Press `ENTER` or click `Patch` to overwrite the current instruction with the new code, then *automatically* advance to the the next instruction.
        - Note that when the new code is shorter than the original code, the extra bytes will be filled in with `NOPs` by default. Uncheck the choice `Padding extra bytes with NOPs` if this is not desired.
    - By default, the modification you made is only recorded in the IDA database. To apply these changes to the original binary (thus overwrite it), choose menu `Edit | Patch program | Apply patches to input file`.

- To do some code assembling (without overwritting binary), open **Keypatch Assembler** from menu `Edit | Keypatch | Assembler`.
    - Choose the architecture, address, endian mode & syntax, then type assembly instruction in the `Assembly` box.
    - Keypatch would *automatically* update the encoding in the `Encode` box while you are typing, without waiting for `ENTER` keystroke.

### Appendix. Install Keystone for IDA Pro

IDA Pro's Python is 32-bit itself, so it can only loads 32-bit libraries. For this reason, we have to build & install Keystone 32-bit. This section details the steps towards that goal.

#### A1. Windows

It is easiest to just download & install Python 2.7 module for Windows from [http://www.keystone-engine.org/download](http://www.keystone-engine.org/download). Be sure to get the 32-bit version, regardless of your Windows edition.

If you prefer to compile from source, just use MSVC 32-bit & follow the instructions in [Windows documentation](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/blob/master/docs/COMPILE-WINDOWS.md) to build `keystone.dll`. After that, install Python module as in [Python documentation](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/blob/master/bindings/python/README.md). Then copy `keystone.dll` to the directory of Keystone Python module.

#### A2. MacOS

Install the core & Python module of Keystone with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo pip install keystone-engine
{% endhighlight %}

#### A3. Linux

First of all, be sure that your machine already have Cmake installed. On Ubuntu, you can install Cmake with:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
{% endhighlight %}

Then if your system is Linux 32-bit, you can install Keystone via `pip` as with MacOS above.

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo pip install keystone-engine
{% endhighlight %}

In case you are on 64-bit Linux, you need to cross compile Keystone to 32-bit. Since version 0.9.1, Keystone supports `lib32` option to make this easy. After building the core, install Python module as in [Python documentation](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/blob/master/bindings/python/README.md).

Note that to cross-compile on Linux, you need to install some multilib libraries. For example, on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit, do this with:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++-4.8-dev libc6-dev-i386
{% endhighlight %}

After having multilib dependencies, run the following commands in the source directory of Keystone.

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../make-share.sh lib32 lib_only
$ cd bindings/python
$ sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, copy the 32-bit binaries at `build/llvm/lib/libkeystone.so.*` to the Python directory of IDA Pro, for example at `/opt/IDAPro6.4/python/`.

Done? Now go back to [section 2](#2-install) & install Keypatch for IDA Pro. Enjoy!
