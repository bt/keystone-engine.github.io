We are very excited to launch the crowd-funding campaign for Keystone assembler engine on [IndieGogo](https://igg.me/at/keystone/)!

A multi-architecture, multi-platform open source assembler framework is a missing piece in a chain of fundamental engines for reverse engineering. After [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org) & [Unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org), Keystone is the latest of our on-going effort to bring better tools to the security community.

Keystone involves a lot of hardwork, however. Therefore, we hope to have community support via this IndieGogo campaign, so we can push this to the end goal, and all of us can finally have a nice asseembler engine!

Get behind Keystone project, so together we can solve the problem of missing an assembler framework once, and for all: [https://igg.me/at/keystone/](https://igg.me/at/keystone/).
