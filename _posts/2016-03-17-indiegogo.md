We are very excited to launch the crowd-funding campaign for Keystone assembler engine on IndieGogo!

A multi-architecture, multi-platform open source assembler framework is a final missing piece a chain of fundamental engines for reverse engineering. After [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org) & [Unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org), Keystone is the latest of our on-going effort to bring better tools to the security community.

Keystone involves a lot of hardwork, however. Therefore, we are launching this campaign on IndieGogo, so community can make us feel more encouraged to push this to the final end goal, and we can have a great asseembler engine!

Get behind Keystone project, so together we can solve the problem of missing the assembler framework once, and for all.
