We are very excited to announce that we already released Keystone source code to some early adopters! Together, we will work hard to find and clean as many bugs as possible before making it public later.

We would like to thank those who are willing to put valuable time & efforts to help us in this phase! Believe us, the code are in good hands right now :-)
