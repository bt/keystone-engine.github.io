Our Indiegogo fundraising for Keystone project was successful with 165% funded! Thank you a lot to all the awesome 98 backers, you are the motivation and the very reason why Keystone was successfully funded, and will become available to public soon!

Since our [stretch goal](/indiegogo2) was also reached, we will have support for GNU Gas & Nasm syntax in the first release of Keystone.

Here is our quick plan:

- We will ship stickers to all the backers from level-32 and up soon from next week.

- We are still collecting requests on T-shirt at the moment. We will order T-shirt printing after that, then post to all the backers from level-128 and up. We hope to start shipping from next week.

- We are cleaning up code and fixing some issues. All the backers from level-512 and up will get the source code in about 2 weeks.

- We will send the source code to all the backers of level-256 sometime in May.

- If we can fix all the major issues, the first release of Keystone to pubic will be out in May or June.

More update about our project will be shared soon.
