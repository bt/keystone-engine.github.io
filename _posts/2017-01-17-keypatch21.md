We are very excited to release [Keypatch 2.1](http://keystone-engine.org/keypatch), the [award-winning](https://www.hex-rays.com/contests/2016/index.shtml) assembler for IDA Pro!

New features provided by this version includes:

- Added a new "Search" function to search for assembly instructions, so it is easy to grep
  for ROP gadgets in the binary. This will be helpful for exploitation writers.
- Removed the "Assembler" function, which is now redundant since you can also do
  that with the "Search" function above.
- Better documentation for Linux & Windows installs.
